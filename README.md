`Fridge Reducer` suggests recipes you can make with ingredients already in your kitchen, and suggests new recipes you can make with just a few more ingredients from the store. After selecting the recipes, a grocery list will be generated of what you need to go buy.

## Setup

*The following assumes you have `git`, `npm`, and `mysql` installed on your machine.*
1. Clone this repo to your desktop.
2. Open terminal and navigate to the repo, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Two files, `schema.sql` and `data.sql`, have everything you need to install a demo database in MySQL. Another file, `database.config.js`, is used as the credentials for accessing MySQL. Check that it will work with your setup, change if necessary. If changes are necessary, update the `database-reset` script in `package.json` as well.
4. Run `npm run database-reset`. This will set up the database and populate it.

## Usage

After following the directions in the `Setup` section, you'll need to run 2 scripts:
- `npm run react-dev`
- `npm run server-dev`

At this point you should be able to access it on `http://localhost:3000`, *bon app√©tit*.
